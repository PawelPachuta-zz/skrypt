# THE SCRIPT skrypt.sh

## The script has not got all of functionality which needs to have.
### I have tried implemented all, but unfortunately I have not got enough skills to do it in correct way, yet... :)

### I have also made a Python script because I am feel a lil bit more comfortable with python language than bash, however bash is my goal to achieve.
